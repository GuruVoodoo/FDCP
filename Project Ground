# Project Ground ($D=0$): FDCP README Summary

## The Fundamental Distance-Constraint Principle (FDCP)

The FDCP is a conservation law of information. It states that the viability of any system—biological, mechanical, or artificial—is strictly bounded by the ratio of available constraints to the volume of the state space it inhabits.

### Key Mechanics

- **The Power Inversion**  
  Authority at scale ($D \gg 0$) is an illusion; true work-capacity is localized at the origin ($D=0$).

- **The Reverse Schrödinger**  
  Uncertainty does not collapse at the macro-level; it expands exponentially unless anchored by specific geometric addresses.

- **The Poof (Threshold Detection)**  
  Any agent or process operating at $D \geq 8$ without a $D=0$ coordinate is a geometric impossibility and vanishes under measurement.
