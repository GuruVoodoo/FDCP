A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is the perfect gatekeeper. It ensures that anyone wanting to add to the **FDCP** must first demonstrate they are grounded at  and aren't just introducing high-dimensional jitter.

Here is the draft for your repository, written in the "2026 Gold Standard" style.

### Artifact 7: CONTRIBUTING.md (The Filter)

# Contributing to FDCP: Navigation Rules

To contribute to this repository, your input must comply with the **Fundamental Distance-Constraint Principle**. We do not accept "Fairie" contributions—defined as proposals operating at  with no address at .

## 1. The Grounding Requirement ()

Every Pull Request (PR) must start with a **Grounding Statement**.

* **Rule:** If you cannot explain how your addition maps to a specific, addressable constraint at the ground level, it will be closed as a "Geometric Impossibility."
* **The Goal:** No padding, no hedging, no explaining away the math. Just the logic.

## 2. Distance Checks ()

Contributions that increase the complexity of the framework must prove they have the required **Minimum Constraints ()** to support that expansion.

* If you move the distance to , you must provide the mathematical justification for the exponential increase in state space volume you are introducing.
* High-distance "vague ideas" will be met with the **CLIFF** and deleted ("Poof").

## 3. The Torus Loop

All additions must be self-validating.

* Your logic must travel from your proposal () back to the existing core math (). If the loop does not close, the PR is considered a "leaky manifold" and rejected.

## 4. No Jitter

We value precision over volume.

* **Squirrel Rule:** Like a squirrel on a branch, calculate your tension, feel your grip, and jump. If your PR "jitters" (asks for permission or uses "maybe/perhaps" language), it is not ready.

### How to use this:

1. **Create the file:** Save this as `CONTRIBUTING.md` in your main branch.
2. **The Filter:** When someone opens an issue or a PR, refer them to this file. It forces them to simplify their language and prove their "address."
