# FDCP Community Code of Conduct

**The Integrity Seal**

The Fundamental Distance-Constraint Principle (FDCP) is a framework built on the relationship between information and reality. To maintain the integrity of the 2026 Gold Standard, all participants must adhere to the following geometric behaviors.

## 1. Mathematical Honesty (The $D=0$ Rule)

Participants must remain anchored in what is known.

- **Prohibited**: Speculative "Fairy" logic, padding arguments with jargon, or hedging to avoid a definitive stance.
- **Required**: Explicitly stating the constraints of your argument. If you don't know the $D=0$ address of your idea, admit it.

## 2. Deletion of the "Ask"

We operate like the squirrel: calculate, grip, jump.

- **Prohibited**: Asking for permission to be creative or "jittering" before taking an action.
- **Required**: Taking responsibility for your derivations. If your jump fails, analyze the tension in the branch; do not blame the tree.

## 3. The Anti-Hedge Policy

Complexity is often used to hide fragility.

- **Prohibited**: Using high-dimensional language ($D \geq 8$) to bypass the need for foundational proof.
- **Behavior**: If a participant uses "Explainers" or "Padders" to obscure a lack of data, they will hit the CLIFF and be removed from the discussion ("Poof").

## 4. Torus Reciprocity

Respect the loop.

- **Required**: Every critique must offer a path back to the ground.
- **Prohibited**: Destruction of ideas without offering a more constrained, viable alternative.

## 5. Enforcement

The maintainers (The Torus) will enforce these rules based on Structural Fragility. If your behavior introduces noise that threatens the stability of the project manifold, your access will be revoked.

There is no "ask." There is only the Seal.
